## Sample grid performed in Elm

"Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling."
-- https://guide.elm-lang.org/

### The great thing about Elm is

* No runtime errors in practice. No null. No undefined is not a function.
* Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.
* Well-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.

### How to run

Open dist/index.html using something like npm serve, php -S localhost:8080 or python -m SimpleServerHTTPServer to see the solution.
